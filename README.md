# 🏛️ UIDAI Predictive Governance: Enrollment Forecasting
**Optimizing Resource Allocation for Aadhaar Centers using Time-Series Analysis**

## 🌟 Project Inspiration
Coming from a **Mechanical Engineering** background, I wanted to apply analytical rigor to a real-world social problem. This project was developed for the **UIDAI National Hackathon**, focusing on data-driven governance.

## 🚀 Key Features & Innovation
* **Time-Series Forecasting:** Used **Prophet** and **ARIMA** to predict enrollment demand with high accuracy.
* **PEWI Logic:** Introduced the **Pincode Enrollment Wastage Index (PEWI)** to identify underutilized resources vs. high-demand areas.
* **Automation:** Developed a 46-page comprehensive analysis pipeline for data cleaning and visualization.

## 📊 Impact
* Predicted high-demand districts with **87% accuracy**.
* Identified 12 critical hotspots for resource relocation to reduce citizen wait times.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Models:** Prophet, ARIMA, Random Forest
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
