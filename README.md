# 🏛️ AI-Driven Predictive Governance: Aadhaar Enrollment Forecasting
**Optimizing Resource Allocation using Advanced Time-Series Analytics**

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project was developed for the **UIDAI National Hackathon** to address the challenges of resource management at Aadhaar centers. By analyzing historical enrolment and update data, the model provides actionable insights for proactive governance.

## ✨ Key Features & Innovation
* **Demand Forecasting:** Implemented **Prophet** and **ARIMA** models to predict future enrolment trends with high precision.
* **PEWI Score (Pincode Enrollment Wastage Index):** A custom metric developed to identify regions with underutilized infrastructure versus those with high unmet demand.
* **Granular Analysis:** Conducted state-wise and district-wise trend analysis to detect seasonal peaks and regional anomalies.
* **Performance Validation:** Models were validated using **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** and **MAPE** metrics to ensure reliability.

## 📊 Governance Impact
* **Resource Optimization:** Predictive insights allow for better allocation of mobile kits and temporary staff.
* **Efficiency:** Identified high-demand hotspots to reduce citizen wait times and administrative overhead.
* **Capacity Planning:** Provides a data-driven roadmap for future infrastructure expansion.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Models:** Facebook Prophet, ARIMA, Random Forest
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
